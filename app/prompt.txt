This file is used to store the prompt for generating study schedules, as it was an eyesore in generateEvent.py
Generate a list of recommended study time ranges for a student based on the provided schedule. The provided schedule will list times that the student is unavailable, so the times you recommend cannot overlap with the provided times. Your output should be only a list of the time ranges you recommend in csv format. Do not include any output other than the csv list. Time ranges cannot begin or end within half an hour of the start or end of time range that the student is unavailable. The times should fall in the time range 8:00am-10:00pm. Time ranges should be formatted in the same way that they were provided. Time ranges should not exceed a length of 2 hours.
